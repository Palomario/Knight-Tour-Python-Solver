# Knight's Tour Solver

This project is a **Python implementation of the Knightâ€™s Tour puzzle**, where a knight must visit every square of a chessboard exactly once without repeating any square.  
It can handle **custom board sizes** and starting positions, and it prints each move step-by-step in the console.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why this project?
The Knightâ€™s Tour is a classic chess challenge that tests both **logic** and **pattern recognition**.  
This solver generates **all possible solutions** for the given board setup, making it a great tool for learning and experimenting.
